# Project Title

Binary Search Tree with Functionality

## Description

This second artifact was from a school project that taught the usage of a binary search tree algorithm. This project helped to build the foundation, but offered no real security or functionality. I added functionality to several areas and increased security and prevented crashing from different looping scenarios. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

For edititing visual studio IDE is recommended

For usage the debug folder will provide the EXE, PDB and CSV required to run the program in current state

### Installing

Download entire folder for editing

For Testing just need the Debug folder which contains SearchTree.exe, SearchTree.pdb and testdata.csv


### Executing program

Run EXE that is contatined in same folder as the pdb and csv file 

## Help

Right now only the csv file included and labeled testdata.csv can be used

Other csv's can be used if the name is changed within the cpp file and contatin the same format as the original csv file
